## What is Bunnette Bank?
Bunnette Bank, or BB for short, is a word bank website built to store words locally on the user's computer. The primary purpose of of BB is to store new words as one encounters them while reading a novel. Although the website is not fully responsive and is only built for computer with optimal resolution of 1920x1080, it fully serves it's purpose and is very easy to use.

## Origin of Bunnette Bank
While I was reading a novel named "Lord of the Mysteries", I came across many words that I was unfamiliar with. The only thing I could do was search their meanings online and then later after a few days of time when I encounter them again, I would forget what they meant. So, I developed this website so that the words I come across are forever stored in my local storage and are easy to access.

## How to use the website for myself?
It is very easy and simple to set up the website and start using it.
1. Download this respository as zip file.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Open the extracted folder using any IDE (I prefer VS Code)
4. Open the terminal (VS Code: Ctrl + Shift + \` ), and then type: <pre>`npm install`</pre>This will install all the dependencies required (if any).
5. After everything is finished downloading, type: <pre>`node .`</pre>
6. Copy the address that pops up. Most likely, it would be: <pre>`http://localhost:5500`</pre>Unless you change the port, it would remain same.
7. Go to a browser and paste it in the search box. You are good to go!
